        <p><h1>Whale Watching Trincomalee | Sri Lanka</h1><span>Trincomalee, on the eastern coast of the island, has also rapidly emerged as an internationally-significant whale-watching destination.

            whales (plus smaller numbers of sperm whales) can regularly be spotted around 6-8 nautical miles east of Trincomalee (about half an hour by boat).
            These magnificent beasts can even be spotted from the shore on occasion – with Swami Rock offering the best vantage point.
          
            Dolphins are also regularly seen with the Spinner Dolphins being the most frequently spotted while most sightings occur between March/April and August/September.
            Whales continue their migrations around the island from the south coast (where they mainly congregate from December to April) which means that whale watching is an excursion which is available in Sri Lanka
            for around ten months of the year at different points around the coastline.</span> </p>
