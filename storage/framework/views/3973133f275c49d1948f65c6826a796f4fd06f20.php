    <p><h1>Blue Whale</h1>The blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is a marine mammal belonging to the baleen whale parvorder, 
    Mysticeti. At up to 29.9 metres (98 ft)in length and with a maximum recorded weight of 173 tonnes 
    (190 short tons), it is the largest animal known to have ever existed.Long and slender, 
the blue whale's body can be various shades of bluish-grey dorsally and somewhat lighter underneath.
 There are at least three distinct subspecies: B. m. musculus of the North Atlantic and North Pacific,
  B. m. intermedia of the Southern Ocean and B. m. brevicauda (also known as the pygmy blue whale) 
  found in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean. B. m. indica, found in the Indian Ocean, may be another subspecies.
   As with other baleen whales, its diet consists almost exclusively of small crustaceans known as krill.</p>

    <p><h1>Humpback Whale</h1>Humpback whales are rorquals, members of the Balaenopteridae family that includes the blue, fin, Bryde's, 
    sei and minke whales. The rorquals are believed to have diverged from the other families of the suborder Mysticeti 
    as long ago as the middle Miocene era.However, it is not known when the members of these families diverged from each other.
    Though clearly related to the giant whales of the genus Balaenoptera, the humpback is the sole member of its genus.
    Recent DNA sequencing has indicated the humpback is actually more closely related to certain rorquals, 
    particularly the fin whale (B. physalus) and possibly the gray (Eschrichtius robustus), than it is to others such as the minke.</p>
    
    Humpbacks can easily be identified by their stocky body, obvious hump, black dorsal coloring and elongated pectoral fins. The head and lower jaw are covered with knobs called tubercles, 
    which are hair follicles and are characteristic of the species.
     The fluked tail, which typically rises above the surface when diving, has wavy trailing edges.

    <p><h1>Fin Whale</h1>The fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), also known as finback whale or common rorqual and formerly known as herring whale or razorback whale, 
    is a marine mammal belonging to the parvorder of baleen whales. It is the second-largest species on Earth after the blue whale. 
    The largest reportedly grow to 27.3 m (89.6 ft) long with a maximum confirmed length of 25.9 m (85 ft), a maximum recorded weight of nearly 74 tonnes (73 long tons; 82 short tons),
    and a maximum estimated weight of around 114 tonnes (112 long tons; 126 short tons). American naturalist Roy Chapman Andrews called the fin whale "the greyhound of the sea ... for its beautiful,
    slender body is built like a racing yacht and the animal can surpass the speed of the fastest ocean steamship."

    <p><h1>Southern Bottlenose Whale</h1>The southern bottlenose whale is fairly rotund and measures 7.5 m (25 ft) in length when physically mature, 
    considerably smaller than the northern bottlenose whale. The melon is extremely bluff. The beak is long and white on males but grey in females. 
    The dorsal fin is relatively small at 30–38 cm (12–15 in), set behind the middle of the back, falcate (sickle-shaped), and usually pointed. The back is light-to-mid grey.
     It has a lighter underside.The southern bottlenose whale has a circumpolar distribution in the Southern Ocean. It is found as far south as the Antarctic coast and as far north as the tip of South Africa, New Zealand's North Island and the southern parts of Brazil. The global population is unknown.
    Sightings of bottlenose whales in tropical and subtropical waters belong to a poorly known species, 
    Longman's beaked whale.

    <p><h1>Short-finned Pilot Whale</h1>The short-finned whale has a stocky body, a bulbous forehead, no prominent beak, long flippers sharply pointed at the tip, black or dark grey color, 
    and the dorsal fin set forward on body. The flukes are raised before a deep dive; they may float motionless at the surface, frequently are seen in very large groups, prefer deep water, 
    and may be approached. Their diets are composed of fish, squid, and octopus.
    They are known as the 'cheetahs of the deep' for the high-speed pursuits of squid at depths of hundreds of metres.
    Short-finned pilot whales, unlike the related long-finned pilot whale, are found in most waters around the world. 
    They primarily inhabit warm tropical waters, but usually stay offshore in the deeper waters. 
    They also tend to be found in areas with a high density of squid.</p>
